Make sure you have .net desktop runtime 7.0 (not to be confused with .net runtime 7.0)

Select your body, race, texture, etc and hit generate. The tool should spit out files with all the nessecary path names.

Just hit rediscover in penumbra and use.

.tex generation is forked from Penumbra.

Requires Penumbra to use.

Core features:
- Drag and drop texture assignment
- Automatic path generation
- Automatic penumbra options, and ability to customize groups for exports to penumbra
- png, dds, bmp, and .tex support (yes you can compile existing makeup or body mods into this tool with just the .tex files) 
- Ability to add custom texture paths if this tool doesn't already autogenerate them
- Automatic redraw on generation
- Can automatically generate normals, if only a diffuse is provided, or alternatively merge the generated normal data with existing normals.
- Low learning curve.
